# Password Generator

This vanilla JavaScript password generator was created based on Florin Pop's 10 projects in 10 hours challenge. (Reference: https://github.com/florinpop17/10-projects-10-hours)

The password generator can generate passwords that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It also offers the copy-to-clipboard option.
